            <h1>A Brief History of Thanksgiving</h1>
            <p>Thanksgiving is a national holiday in the United States, celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November every year. The tradition of Thanksgiving dates back to 1621, when the Pilgrims, early European colonizers of the United States, held a harvest feast to celebrate their first successful crop.</p>
            <p>The Wampanoag Native American tribe had helped the Pilgrims adapt to their new environment and taught them how to farm. The feast lasted for three days and was attended by around 50 Pilgrims and 90 Wampanoag guests.</p>
            <p>In 1789, George Washington, the first president of the United States, declared a national day of thanksgiving to commemorate the adoption of the United States Constitution. However, it wasn't until 1863, during the Civil War, that Thanksgiving became a national holiday, when President Abraham Lincoln declared it a day of thanksgiving and praise.</p>
